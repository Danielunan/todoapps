simple to do list web application, i've built this as my research project compared database mysql and nosql using laravel.

to install it, just "git clone https://github.com/Danielunan/todoapps.git" or download it it's ok

move your laravel file to localhost directory, and

open terminal (OS X), command prompt (Windows), typing "composer install" and wait a few minutes, and

after finished composer install, typing again "php artisan generate key" wait, and viola ready to use.

note: forgive me, i can't share todoapp using nosql because not accomplished yet, still any bugs. i'm fixed as soon as possible.

the credit by c. michael for tutorials and other team nerd laravel helped me developed this apps. thank you very much.
