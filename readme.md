simple to do list web application, i've built this as my research project compared database mysql and nosql using laravel.

to install it, just "git clone https://github.com/Danielunan/todoapps.git" or download it it's ok

move your laravel file to localhost directory, and

open terminal (OS X), command prompt (Windows), typing "composer install" and wait a few minutes, and

after finished composer install, typing again "php artisan generate key" wait, and viola ready to use.

note: forgive me, i can't share todoapp using nosql because not accomplished yet, still any bugs. i'm fixed as soon as possible.
